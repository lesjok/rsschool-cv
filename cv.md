## Briefly About Myself:

What I like most about web development is the opportunity to manifest my creative abilities (for example, when styling objects), as well as use my skills to think logically (for example, when writing functionality for these objects). I also like to use learn and use English at work. For these reasons, I wanted to try myself in the world of development.

To learn new technologies and practice my skills, I solve problems on Codewars and Leetcode, take part in hackathons, take courses from HTML-Academy, Yandex.Practicum, Rolling Scopes School, watching videos on Youtube channels: Front-end Science, Ulbi TV and so on.

I really like to study and get new knowledge. Also, during my training, I learned to search and find solutions on the Internet on my own. I consider this to be my strong point.

In my free time I like to read books and play the piano.

## Code example:
***Fibonacci Number from LEETCODE***

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

```
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).
```

====

```
var fib = function(number) {
  const result = [0, 1];

  for(let i = 2; i <= number; i++) { 
    const prevNum1 = result[i - 1];
    const prevNum2 = result[i - 2];
    result.push(prevNum1 + prevNum2);
  }
  return result[number];
};
```
